# VisualChessStudioNau64

This is an experimental Chess project currently implemented on Dolphin Smalltalk (https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin). 

Dolphin Smalltalk will be used a Development Environment but at some point everything will run on GemStone/S.

Current tasks:
* Chess Pieces movements
* Visual Display

Future Task:
* Chess tactics searcher
* Minimal chess engine
* Ideas searcher
* GemStone/S compilation (for parallel processing)
